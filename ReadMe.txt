RUN CODE:

1. in terminal run: node Furnace.js
2. in seperate terminal run:  node Thermostat.js
3. in browser goto:  https://localhost:3001/

Notes:

Currently setting the desired temperature from the browser is not implemented.
The function to change the desired temperature is there, but I couldn't figure out
how to activate it and use data from the button.
